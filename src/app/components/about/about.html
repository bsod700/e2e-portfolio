            I'm a UI/UX Designer &amp; Full Stack Developer who builds intuitive, innovative 
            digital experiences. With deep expertise in design, development, and AI, I create 
            end-to-end solutions that solve real problems.

            My passion lies in merging cutting-edge technology with clean design. Whether 
            building complex web apps, crafting delightful user interfaces, or leveraging AI 
            to enhance functionality, I approach every project with strategic thinking and 
            technical precision.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I've worked with over 500+ clients worldwide, delivering projects that combine 
            technical excellence with exceptional user experiences. From startups to enterprise 
            solutions, I bring ideas to life with modern tools and best practices.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            When I'm not coding or designing, I'm staying up-to-date with the latest web 
            technologies, exploring AI innovations, and continuously improving my craft. 
            I believe in writing clean code, creating scalable architectures, and designing 
            with empathy for the end user.
